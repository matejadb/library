# Library Project

This is a library management project based on [The Odin Project's "Library" exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). The application allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, displaying, and modifying their read status. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean and interactive user interface.
